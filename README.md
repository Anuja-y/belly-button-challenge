# belly-button-challenge

A dynamic and interactive dashboard was created to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which provides information about the microbial communities inhabiting human navels. The dataset is in JSON format.

The analysis of the dataset reveals that a small number of microbial species, known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were found in more than 70% of individuals, while the remaining species were relatively uncommon.

The dashboard includes dynamic demographics information that updates based on the selected test subject ID. Additionally, there are interactive visualizations such as a bar chart, bubble chart, and a bonus gauge chart that automatically update when the ID is changed. The code for this dashboard was developed using Plotly, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.
